Announcing the Hackathon Challenge for the [Visual Text Analytics and Social Science Workshop](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/engineering/datascienceinstitute/eventssummary/event_8-3-2016-14-23-57), to be held at Imperial College London and the London School of Economics, 24-25 March 2015.

### Rules

1. Download the contest corpus, which consists of the US Presidential candidate debates from the current election. These are available as: 
  * a [zip file of plain texts **here**](http://www.kenbenoit.net/files/presidential_debates_2015-2016.zip)
  * a [quanteda](https://github.com/kbenoit/quanteda) [corpus object](http://www.kenbenoit.net/files/presidential_debates_2015-2016.zip), which can be loaded in R using

```R
load(url("http://www.kenbenoit.net/files/presDebateCorpus2016seg.RData"))
```  

This is separated by speaker and including full meta-data at the document level &#8211; a bonus since this involved significant processing. (See the [.R file used to do this](http://www.kenbenoit.net/files/create_presidential_debates_corpus.R).)
        
2. Produce a visualization from some analysis of any or all of the texts above. This is completely open-ended.
3. Notify <a title="Nina McCullagh link opens in a new window" href="mailto:N.McCullagh@lse.ac.uk" target="_blank">Nina McCullagh</a> that you are coming and to get a slot on the contest presentation, and then show up at 4pm to the Hackathon Challenge presentations on 25 March (see schedule), prepared to make a 5 minute presentation of your visualization. In 5 minutes you should: 
    1. present the visualization as a slide
    2. explain what it is meant to convey
    3. describe the tool(s) you used to produce it

### Prizes

The audience will vote on three criteria: informativeness; aesthetics; and technical prowess. **Prizes** will be awarded in each category and overall. All entries from consenting entrants will be posted on a website setup from the workshop.
