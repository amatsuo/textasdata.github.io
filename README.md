# Text-As-Data on Jekyll

This is a repository for "Text-As-Data" webpage ([textasdata.com](http://textasdata.com)), which is intended to contribute to a dissemination of the knowledge on the computer content analysis through text as data approach. For more information please refer to "/about/approach/". 

The website is originally hosted on wordpress, and we migrate it to Jekyll and hosted as a github page.
